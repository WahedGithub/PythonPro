** For freezing the object which is reffered to mjultiple objects immutability of data types is required in python

** Ex: 1 crore voters from hyd have same city if one user changes name for all it will get change thats y its is 
immutable.

**Except complex all other data types can be Reused

Python Idle have the capacity for int from 0-256 value above that it will give as false even both the objects are having the same value thats the limitation of idle.

** List is mutable

** Collection Related Data Types can be used by (List,tuple,set,dict,range,bytes,bytearray,frozenset)

** In list duplicate objects are allowed, order is peserved(maintained), heterogenous(diff type of objects) are allowed, indexing and slicing is allowed, list is mutable,

l = [10,'durga', 20,10,30]
print(type(l))

** single element/object tuple should end with ,
t= (10,) without comma it will take it as int value

** in Set: indexing will not support as it doesn't have ordering
1. duplicates are not allowed 2. Order not required 3.Indexing/slicing not allowed 4. Heterogenous objects are allowed.
** In set add is used instead of append to the add the value.

s={}
>>> print(type(s))
<class 'dict'> ##it is coz dict is frequently used thats why
** To create empty set give 
s= set()
print(type(s))

Diff b/w list & set
list--order is imp. 2.duplicates(ok). 3.[] | set--order is not imp. 2. Duplicates(NOK), 3.{}

Bytes data type--is used very rarely-for images,videos etc., define a list and assign it as a byte.
Byte is immutable, here values should be 0-255 only
byte or bytearray
byte is immutable and bytearray is mutable only difference

Int,Float,complex,bool,str are fundamental data types
List, Tuple, Dict, Set,Frozenset, range, byte & bytearray are extra datatypes.

None Data type--none means nothing or no value associated 
its like **Null in java**
None is also and object coz in python everything is an object.
None can be only one object even multiple objects are defined.

In python print can pass any number of arguments**

ESCAPE Character: Which have some special Functionality
\n--> New line
\t--> Horizontal tab
\r-->Carriage return --->its like home(takes to starting) of the line
\b-->Backspace-->deletes one character
\f-->form feed-->
\'-->Single quote--> to use single quote instead of getting error in between string or int
\"-->Double quote-->to use double quote instead of getting error in between string or int
\\-->Backslash-->

COMMENTS:
# This is single line comment
#Line 1 , #line 2, #line 3 This is multi line comments
'''line1
	line2
	line3''' this is called doc string
	
Constants In Python--> are not APPLICABLE here
MAX_LENGTH=10-->if you dont want to change the value define in upper case
