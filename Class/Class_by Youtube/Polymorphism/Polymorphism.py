print ("PolyMorphism -- Poly = Many, Morph = from ")

We have various types in Polymorphism
1. Ducking typing -->in this method/function should have the same name to execute this
2. Operator Overloading--> this has operator + magic methods(__add__, __sub__, __mul__, etc) with this can work on different arguments and types of variables
3. Method Overloading --> is not supported in python but we have different methods to use it though
4. Method Overriding--> Is the same way like using def show in inheritance first it will check for child class else it will go to parent class
